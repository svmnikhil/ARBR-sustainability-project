# ARBR-sustainability-project
Code is available in the main file. Keep in mind that this is solely the backend required to run the arduino. 
- The Ardunio's LCD display is placed on the vehicle dashboard. It prompts the driver--upon starting the car, to also start the rehabilitation/awareness program. 
- The program's intention is to count the number of trees that need to be planted in order to equalize the tons of CO2 released in certain increments of time. 
- The program takes into account the mpg efficiency of the car and calculates how much CO2 it would be releasing for every km of travel. This number is translated into number of trees that need to be planted during the trip.
- The mpg efficiency is inputted by the driver via "UP" and "DOWN" buttons on the module as a constant and is stored as flash memory.
